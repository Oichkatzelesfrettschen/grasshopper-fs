Txn layer knows about inodes, no need to pass them on commit.  Perhaps
can also simplify inode cache.

Clean up tnx layer by enumerating the 3 logical operations that can
happen: update a bit, update inode size object, update block.  Maybe a
buf has offset, sz. Goal: factor out allocator and support several
inodes per block.  Cache will be below logging layer.

Change allocator to start threads in different parts of the allocator,
so that they cannot set the same bit.  If cannot find one, start in a
different place.  Goal: don't to allocator on commit lock.  Don't need
two bitmaps.

Test for reallocating inode before shrunk

directories ls: if lock ordering problem, return what we have read so far

error codes
  write cnt = 0 should return which error happened

log absorption

test out of fs space

check that inodes are correctly written to disk on abort
  nlink on failure to add to dir
  example NOSPACE?
