Txn layer knows about inodes, no need to pass them on commit. No need
for iput()?

An icache, but simpler now

Test for reallocating inode before shrunk

directories ls: if lock ordering problem, return what we have read so far

error codes
  write cnt = 0 should return which error happened

log absorption

test out of fs space

check that inodes are not modified on disk on abort
  e.g., nlink on failure to add to dir

mtime

performance measurements

implement recovery

test recovery

goosify

log-by-pass writes
