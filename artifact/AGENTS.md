# Artifact notes

The `artifact` directory contains files used for reproducing the GoJournal
artifact from the OSDI 2021 paper. No code in this directory is compiled as
part of the main build. Use the instructions in `artifact/README.md` to
create and run the VM.

Changes in this directory do not require running Go formatting or tests.
