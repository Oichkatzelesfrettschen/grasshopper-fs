Potential improvements:

- The txn layer could implement more fine-grained locking for CommitWait.
  For example, if a transaction is writing full blocks (no inodes or
  bits), it's not necessary to acquire the txn commit lock.  Even more
  aggressively, txn could acquire locks (using a lockmap) for every disk
  block that requires an installation read (sorting the disk block addrs
  to avoid deadlock).  Not clear if that optimization is worth it, though.
